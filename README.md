# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Customer Purchase Prediction with Decision Tree Classifier
# Overview
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this task is sourced from repositories of UCI Machine Learning Repository, the Bank Marketing dataset.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Scikit-learn
# Dataset
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Open the notebook/script and modify it to load your dataset.
4. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Build a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.
6. Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.
7. Tune the hyperparameters of the decision tree model to improve performance if necessary.
8. Interpret the results and analyze the importance of different features in predicting customer purchase behavior.
